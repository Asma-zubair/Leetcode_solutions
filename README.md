# 📘 LeetCode Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to selected LeetCode problems.  
Each problem has its **own folder**, and every folder contains exactly two files:

1. **README.md** — The problem’s full description (question only)  
2. **solution.py** — My Python implementation

This structure keeps each problem organized, simple, and easy to navigate.
